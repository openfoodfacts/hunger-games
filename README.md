## üïπÔ∏è Try it

The production website is available at https://hunger.openfoodfacts.org

## Why Hunger Games?

- Because we are sympathetic to Katniss' fight against Panem.
- Open Food Facts generates a lot of photos, and we need to turn them into reliable data about food and cosmetics, at very large scale.
- We process all pictures using top OCR and Machine earning techniques and get a lot of predictions about the products.
- We then need to let users leverage this data to easily complete products, in a fun way, on their mobiles.

The main goal is: Every Open Food Facts user can annotate products in a few minutes.

## üé® Design & User interface

- We strive for a playful and refined UI that's very efficient on the Web and on Mobile.

## Outstanding issues

- We need performance improvements server side (degrading the experience)
- We need to step up our design, as well as cognitive load on the users for the questions

## Requirements:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org)

## Setup

### Node & Yarn

- [Install Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [Install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
- Install libraries: `yarn install`
- run the project locally `yarn dev`

### Build with Yarn

```
yarn build
```

### Generate the Countries list

```
yarn countries
```

Generates the JSON file `src/assets/countries.json` which contains all the countries available on OFF taxonomy. Data are obtained from static.openfoodfacts.org

### Update the Taxonomy auto-complete file

```
node update-taxonomy-suggestions.js
```

Fetch categories and labels taxonomy from Open Food Facts static files, and generate JSON files used by the `Autocomplete` fields.

### Maintenance - How to define a dashboard

Go to `src/pages/logosValidator/dashboardDefinition.ts`. You have two objects to edit:

- `LOGOS` which contains the logos available in dashboards. Add the logos you need by providing at least `tag`, `label`, and `logo` properties.
- `DASHBOARD` which for a dashboard associates an array of logos.

## Libraries we depend on

- React
- [MUI](mui.com) (UI library based on material design)
- Axios (HTTP calls)
